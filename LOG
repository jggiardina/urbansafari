Questions:
-How do we want to deal with jailbreak (teleport all the players back
to their home, or make them find their own way back)
-Can people pick up the flad AND the hammer?
-How many charges on hammer
-should a point be triggered if someone walks into home with the flag,
or if they drop the flag into their home base?
-How should we determine winning the game: score reaches a certain number?
-How should we deal with ties, if they could ever occur?
Decisions:
-Various specifications (flag, wall, jail, player collision)
TO DO:
-Clean up tic tac toe code
-Start loading map
-Define architecture and decide on specification questions
Comments/Notes:
Talked about specification.

Questions:
-Does the graphics library redraw the map constantly, looping through the map data structure.  What are the semantics for reading the data structure in the graphics library?  Do we define them?
-We need to figure out the session data so that we dont need a player id and we just have the pointer to the session on the serverside.  If the client tries to use it it will seg fault obviously because its only valid fo rthe serverside. But the client sends that in the session data.
Decisions:
-Finalized architecture
TO DO:
-Test
-Make architecture and specification pdf's all neat
Comments/Notes:
Loading map code finished, bugs sorted out with in all aspects of code. All to do now is to test and finalize
